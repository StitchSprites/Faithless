## Stitch put whatever you want here for a description


## Guidelines for pushing:
* Don't overwrite textures made by StitchSprites unless there's a VERY strong reason to!
* Make sure your Commits describe what you changed. (Try not to be too vague, but doesn't have to be too strict)
  * Example of what to do: Fixed the Pale Oak Sapling by adding the missing Blockstate json, the missing Block Model json, and the texture for it that was missing.
  * Example of what not to do: Fixed the Pale Oak Sapling.
* Add your name to the bottom of the Credits file if you contributed, but don't remove anyone else's name!
